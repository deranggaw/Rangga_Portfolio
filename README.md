# Portfolio Project
This repository is a demonstration of my abilities and a means to share my work and monitor my advancement in the field of Data Analytics.

I want to share a project I undertook during my time in the intensive Full Stack Data Analytics program at RevoU, which was one of the most challenging assignments I've ever done. The project involved analyzing a complex dataset from a fictional Indonesian Fintech company using only Python as the analysis tool.

As my first step, I conducted a data cleaning process, where I eliminated irrelevant and duplicate values, dealt with missing values and typos, and performed an outlier check using the z-score method. I also transformed and manipulated the data to enhance its quality and improve the efficiency of the analytical processes.

Next, I performed an exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and verify assumptions through the use of summary statistics and graphical representations. This was quite difficult in Python, as it's less convenient to plot or create charts compared to other analysis tools like spreadsheets.

Finally, I executed clustering analysis using the k-means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning method, to group similar users in the dataset into segments.

While taking part in RevoU's Fullstack Data Analytics Program, I had the thrilling chance to investigate the Airbnb market in Singapore and create a related data analytics dashboard with Tableau and GDS. This project particularly piqued my interest because Singapore is renowned for its thriving and diverse tourism sector, making the Airbnb market a worthwhile area to study and comprehend.

One of my key objectives was to emphasize the distribution of Airbnb listings across different neighborhoods in Singapore. To realize this, I crafted an interactive map that showed the position of each listing and offered filtering options for users to effortlessly investigate areas of specific interest.
