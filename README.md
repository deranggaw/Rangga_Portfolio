# About
HI! I'm Derangga Widrananda, I'm a Business Analyst with hands-on experience in ERP implementation, requirements gathering, process optimisation, stakeholder engagement, and data-driven decision support. Currently finalising my Master of Digital Business (Business Analytics) at the University of Waikato (2026), building on my Bachelor of Management from Universitas Prasetiya Mulya, I have delivered measurable improvements across cloud-based ERP platforms, community/not-for-profit organisations, and multi-sector business groups. At Refugee Orientation Centre Trust (ongoing), I lead process mapping, workflow standardisation, budgeting, and funding-compliance initiatives that have reduced miscommunication and improved team coordination by 20%. At Jubelio, I supported ERP enhancements and custom reporting that contributed to an average 15% increase in client sales through better operational and financial visibility. As Head of Business Development and co-founder at Siliwangi Group, I streamlined regulatory processes and provided strategic analysis, cutting processing time by 20% through proactive stakeholder alignment.

I offer strong capabilities in requirements elicitation, functional specifications, process modelling (BPMN, swimlane diagrams), advanced data visualisation and reporting (Power BI, Tableau, Google Data Studio, SQL, Python, Advanced Excel), ERP systems (Jubelio), Salesforce (user level), budgeting, financial planning, and change management. Based in Auckland, I am open to Business Analyst, ERP Analyst, or Digital Transformation roles across New Zealand, with immediate availability on a Post-Study Work Visa pathway. I am passionate about translating complex business and regulatory needs into effective, measurable digital and process solutions, particularly in operationally intensive or compliance-driven environments.

# Portfolio Project
This repository is a demonstration of my abilities and a means to share my work and monitor my advancement in the field of Data Analytics.

## Phyton Assignment

I want to share a project I undertook during my time in the intensive Full Stack Data Analytics program at RevoU, which was one of the most challenging assignments I've ever done. The project involved analyzing a complex dataset from a fictional Indonesian Fintech company using only Python as the analysis tool.

As my first step, I conducted a data cleaning process, where I eliminated irrelevant and duplicate values, dealt with missing values and typos, and performed an outlier check using the z-score method. I also transformed and manipulated the data to enhance its quality and improve the efficiency of the analytical processes.

Next, I performed an exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and verify assumptions through the use of summary statistics and graphical representations. This was quite difficult in Python, as it's less convenient to plot or create charts compared to other analysis tools like spreadsheets.

Finally, I executed clustering analysis using the k-means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning method, to group similar users in the dataset into segments.

While taking part in RevoU's Fullstack Data Analytics Program, I had the thrilling chance to investigate the Airbnb market in Singapore and create a related data analytics dashboard with Tableau and GDS. This project particularly piqued my interest because Singapore is renowned for its thriving and diverse tourism sector, making the Airbnb market a worthwhile area to study and comprehend.

One of my key objectives was to emphasize the distribution of Airbnb listings across different neighbourhoods in Singapore. To realize this, I crafted an interactive map that showed the position of each listing and offered filtering options for users to effortlessly investigate areas of specific interest.

## Market Basket Analysis
  Code: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oVi4tmd-L7We-gB8czTGrMeIBQ8ldW3W?usp=sharing)
  
  Description: Market basket analysis is a technique used in data mining and analytics to identify the relationships between products that customers frequently purchase together. It is based on the concept that if a customer buys a particular product, they are more likely to purchase another related product.

This analysis is commonly used by retailers to understand customer buying patterns and make decisions about product placement, promotions, and pricing. By identifying which products are frequently purchased together, retailers can create targeted marketing strategies and improve their product offerings.
